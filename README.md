Dodge Game

A game where the player will attempt to stay alive in a bullethell-esque game, using the WASD-buttons to move.

The player has 3 lives, and the final score will increase based upon time stayed alive, whilst enemies spawn from left and right in various directions.

This is a school project made by me!
